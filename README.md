# R Deep Learning Projects
This is the code repository for [R Deep Learning Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/r-deep-learning-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788478403), built while learning Deep Learning and the R language through the **Machine Learning Projects with R** book.
## About the Project
In this set of projects, we try to build some common projects like MNIST digit recognition, credit card fault detection and stuff, autoencoder, perceptron building etc.  
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. All modules have codes. Support data files are in the data folder.
The large data files can be downloaded via the links provided in the modules.

The code will look like the following:
```
> for (i in 1:16) {
+ outputData <- as.array
(executor$ref.outputs$activation15_output)[,,i,1]
+ image(outputData, xaxt='n', yaxt='n',
col=grey.colors(255)
+ )
+ }
```

You should be comfortable with R and RStudio and have some knowledge of college-level mathematics (calculus and linear algebra). Working knowledge of basic machine learning algorithms for classification, regression problems, and clustering might be helpful, but it is not strictly required.
